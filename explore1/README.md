# Exploration 1

## Goal

Create a stand-alone work that is useful to some personal, professional, or
academic intersest and to do so using a new set of interesting yet unfamilar
tools.

## Project

An ASCII world in ANSI color, based upon Herbert Wolverson's
Rust tutorial<sup>[1][1]</sup> for Rogue-like<sup>[2][2]</sup> games.

## Questions

* What new (to you!) web tool, application, or program did you try out this week? What new tech skills did you learn from doing this exploration?
* Were you able to create something useful to your Final Project, or your job, or one of your passions? (Did you at least enjoy your exploration?)
* Do you see yourself using this application or program in the future? For what? If not, why not?
* How did you spend your 5 hours?  What did you do in that time?
