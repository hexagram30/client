# Exploration 2

## Goal

Create a stand-alone work that is useful to some personal, professional, or
academic intersest and to do so using a new set of interesting yet unfamilar
tools.

## Project

An ASCII world in ANSI color, based upon Herbert Wolverson's
Rust tutorial<sup>[1][1]</sup> for Rogue-like<sup>[2][2]</sup> games.

In Exploration 2, I want to get to the point where I can create simple maps of
outdoor areas, with creatures that inhabit them.
