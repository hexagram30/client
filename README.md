*Project for Experiential Reflections on Technology*

## Background

I have an open source project called [Hexagram30](https://github.com/hexagram30) the purpose of which is to create the many components necessary to support any number of multi-user, on-line text-based adventure games such as the classic MUDs and MUSHes but with the modern capabilities of distributed systems, high-availability, and fault-tolerance. Much of the work done to date has focused on the ability to connect to a remote session, to store data in specific formats, to generate maps, track time, and use procedural weather data to generate biomes automatically for new worlds.

However, with all the work that I have done in the various code repositories for this project, there is nothing I can currently use to “walk around” in a generated world, nothing that allows me to move a character through the latitudes and longitudes of new worlds with updated textual descriptions that could be presented to the user as the land, vegetation, weather, and seasons change.

I would like to explore the foundations that would be necessary in order to create such a tool, with the hope that after a few iterations, I could determine the feasibility of creating a full-blown client for the Hexagram30 distributed game framework.
